**EG-Delicious-Sync** backups the Delicious links into WordPress links database, and gives you many Delicious features.

== Description ==

Most of plugins related to Delicious allow to display Delicious links, or synchronize the last links. They use RSS features of Delicious, with three main disadvantages:

* They can adress only the last updated or added links,
* Use RSS, even with a cache, can slow down your blog,
* Links are not stored permanently in the WordPress database.

**EG-Delicious-Sync** use the HTTP API of Delicious, and allows to perform a true full backup of your Delicious links, into the WordPress database, in the standard table (wp_links). So, after this synchronization, you can use the standard features of WordPress to manage and display these links (widgets, template tags ...), as if the Delicious posts are local.

You can customize the backup (or synchronization) with a number of options:

* You can entirely control the links classification, by assigning the WordPress categories of links, with the Delicious bundles, or the Delicious tags,
* You can specify if you want a single categories per link, or allow several categories,
* Specify if you want to keep the links already existing in the WordPress databases

Other features:

* An enhanced blogroll widget: display whay you want, where you want!
*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin backups of Delicious links into the WordPress links database. To have a true synchronization, can we update the Delicious database with the WordPress links? =

No, for the moment, because of constraints of the Delicious API: 

* This API allows us to create a link in Delicious database, but we cannot launch a big amount of requests at the same time, because of Delicious securization.
* With this API, we cannot update a link. We just can delete and re-create it, but in this case, the date is wrong.

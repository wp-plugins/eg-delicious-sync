**EG-Delicious-Sync** backups the Delicious links into WordPress links database, and gives you many Delicious features.

== Description ==

Most of plugins related to Delicious allow to display Delicious links, or synchronize the last links. They use RSS features of Delicious, with three main disadvantages:

* They can adress only the last updated or added links,
* Use RSS, even with a cache, can slow down your blog,
* Links are not stored permanently in the WordPress database.

**EG-Delicious-Sync** use the HTTP API of Delicious, and allows to perform a true full backup of your Delicious links, into the WordPress database, in the standard table (wp_links). So, after this synchronization, you can use the standard features of WordPress to manage and display these links (widgets, template tags ...), as if the Delicious posts are local.

Two benefits:

* You have a backup of your Delicious database,
* You manage only one list (Delicious), and you are sure that WordPress links are up to date.

You can customize the backup (or synchronization) with a number of options:

* You can entirely control the links classification, by assigning the WordPress categories of links, with the Delicious bundles, or the Delicious tags,
* You can specify if you want a single categories per link, or allow several categories,
* Specify if you want to keep the links already existing in the WordPress databases

Other features:

* Tags synchronization: align the Delicious tags with Wordpress tags,
* An enhanced blogroll widget: display whay you want, where you want!
* Widgets to display the Delicious Network Badge, and the Delicious tags,
* A full backup (without synchronization) of the Delicious database,
* You can also automaticaly add your WordPress posts in Delicious, when you publish them. With this feature, you can see your post popularity in Delicious (how many people bookmark your posts).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin backups of Delicious links into the WordPress links database. To have a true synchronization, can we update the Delicious database with the WordPress links? =

No, for the moment, because of constraints of the Delicious API: 

* This API allows us to create a link in Delicious database, but we cannot launch a big amount of requests at the same time, because of Delicious securization.
* With this API, we cannot update a link. We just can delete and re-create it, but in this case, the date is wrong.

= How can modify styles or widgets? = 
You have to modify the file `eg-delicious.css` located in the EG-Delicious plugin directory. Two ways:

* Modify directly the `eg-delicious.css` in the plugin directory,
* Or copy this file, in your theme directory, and modify this copy.

The second way is recommended to ensure that your customization won't be lost during a plugin upgrade.
